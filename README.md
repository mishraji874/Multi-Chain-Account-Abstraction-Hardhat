# 🚀 Multi-Chain Account Abstraction Wallet

✨ **Revolutionize Blockchain Interaction with Smart Contract Wallets** ✨

This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-chain account abstraction wallet using Hardhat and Ethereum smart contracts. The wallet allows for flexible account management and cross-chain interactions, providing a seamless user experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🧠 **Smart Contract-Based Accounts**: User accounts managed by smart contracts
- 🌐 **Multi-Chain Support**: Interact with multiple blockchains through bridging protocols
- 🔐 **Enhanced Security**: Custom transaction logic without exposing private keys
- 🛠️ **Flexible Architecture**: Easily upgradable and customizable

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mishraji874/Multi-Chain-Account-Abstraction-Hardhat.git
   cd Multi-Chain-Account-Abstraction-Hardhat
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

### 🧪 Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### 🚀 Deployment
Deploy the contract to your desired network and configure it on the `hardhat.config.js` file:
```bash
npx hardhat run ignition/modules/deploy.ts --network <network_name>
```
